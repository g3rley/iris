<div style="text-align: justify">
This repository contains a data analysis of the iris dataset using multiple machine learning approaches in Python and Jupyter Notebook. The iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. It consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris (setosa, virginica, and versicolor) with four measured features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is commonly used for data mining, classification, clustering, and algorithm testing purposes.
