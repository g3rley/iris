This repository contains a data analysis of the iris dataset using multiples machine learning approaches. The analysis was made using Python and the Jupyter Notebook. The iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper _The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis_. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.
